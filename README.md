# Spotify-Streaming-Analysis-
## Project Overview
This project analyzes Spotify streaming history using SQL to uncover key insights into user listening behavior. By examining factors like stream duration, skip rates, and shuffle mode impact, the goal is to derive meaningful patterns that can enhance music recommendations and improve user experience.

## Key Objectives:
Identify the most played tracks and artists.
Analyze skipping behavior and its impact on listening patterns.
Understand how shuffle mode influences stream duration.
Examine reasons why tracks start and stop playing.
Find tracks with the longest continuous plays.

## Tech Stack
SQL: Used for querying and analyzing streaming data.
Python (Optional): Used for data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Power BI(Optional): Used for dashboard creation and data presentation.


## Key Insights (Findings Summary)
üîπ Most Streamed Tracks & Artists
Identified the top 10 most streamed songs and artists based on total playtime.
üîπ Skip Rate Analysis
Calculated the percentage of skipped tracks to understand user engagement levels.
üîπ Impact of Shuffle Mode
Compared stream duration for tracks played in shuffle mode vs. sequential play.
üîπ Reasons for Track Endings
Analyzed why users stop playing tracks (skipped, track finished, etc.).
üîπ Continuous Playback Trends
Identified tracks that were played for the longest uninterrupted durations.

## How to Run the Analysis
1Ô∏è‚É£ Import the dataset into your SQL database.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the SQL queries provided in the /SQL-Queries/ folder.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze the results and update the findings.
4Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Use Python, Power BI, or Tableau to create visualizations.

## conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into Spotify streaming behavior by analyzing playtime, skipping trends, shuffle impact, and track endings.

### Understanding these trends can help:
